Welcome to my growing portfolio!

I'm **Logan Germain**, a second-year PhD candidate in the Department of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences at Queen‚Äôs University, specializing in Drug Development and Human Toxicology.  
My research explores how drug and chemical exposures during embryonic development can alter epigenetic and gene expression profiles using in vitro techniques and bioinformatics tools ‚Äî changes that may serve as early molecular markers of disease risk or even uncover novel therapeutic pathways.

I'm passionate about **science communication**‚Äîthe art of translating complex technical ideas into clear, accessible insights for various stakeholders and audiences. This is a skill I continue to develop through personal projects and professional "side quests."

I'm equally driven by **strategic decision-making**, whether it's designing experiments based on the latest literature or my results, mentoring undergraduate students, or collaborating across disciplines. 

I thrive in **cross-functional environments**‚Äîfrom coordinating communications at the Birth Defects Research and Prevention Society to serving on the Board of Directors at the Kingston Bouldering Cooperative. I'm used to wearing many hats and adapting quickly based on evolving data or team input.

Lately, I've been exploring the **cell and gene therapy landscape**, and recently completed a draft review article analyzing commercialization challenges and access strategies within a Canadian context. 

Looking ahead, my career interests lie at the intersection of:
- **Science communication**
- **Data-informed decision-making**
- **Dynamic, collaborative problem-solving**

I'm especially excited about roles in **life sciences venture capital** or as a **Medical Science Liaison** in biotech/pharmaceutical companies.
