Welcome to my portfolio!

Welcome! I'm **Logan Germain**, a 2nd year PhD Candidate in the Department of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences at Queen‚Äôs University. 
I'm in the specialied program of Drug Development and Human Toxicology. My research delves into how drug and chemical exposures during embyronic development can alter epigenetic and gene expression profiles,
serving as early molecular markers of disease risk or potential therapeutic pathways.

I am passionate about science communication - about the power of conveying technical information in an easily accessible way. This is a skillset that I am continuously refining through
personal projects and "side-quests". 
I am also driven by strategic decision-making, whether that be through my experimental planning and troubleshooting in my research based on available data and literature,
and collaborating cross-functionally, within teams of my undergrad students, Communications Coordination Committee at BDRP, or on the Board of Directors at the Kingston Bouldering Coop. 
I'm used to wearing many hats, and changing plans on the fly based on emerging evidence or opinions of my teammates. 

I have been exploring personal interests in the cell and gene therapy landscape, and have written a draft review article about commercialization challenges and solutions in a Canadian context. 

My career aspirations include roles in science communication, data-driven decision-making and dynamic collaboration - leading to my interest in life sciences/biotech Venture Capital or Medical Science Liason within pharmaceutical/biotech companies.
